This project is an Artificial Intelligence-powered chat application. AI Model fine-tuned by Md Yeakub Bin Aziz using Google Gemini and Google AI Studio. It combines client-side and server-side technologies to deliver a dynamic and interactive experience.

I have removed my tuned model details and api key's. you can update as you need to setup your own AI Chat App and integrate with your tuned model.

## Features
- **AI Model Integration**: Powered by Google Gemini and fine-tuned for personalized responses.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Server-Side Logic**: Backend functionality implemented using PHP.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Includes a typing indicator for better user interaction.
- **Low Resource Usage** : This code is very lightweighted and will not use excessive resources from the server.
